# DEVOPS CULTURE IN AN ORGANIZATION

In a DevOps organization,collaboration between development and operations is encouraged. Project goals are discussed by stakeholders and developer teams where they create a plan to achieve their goal. The plan is created using various project management tools like Jira, pivotal tracker. This helps with capacity planning and good progress management of the project.

Through agile methodology, teams are required to focus on product quality and speed delivery through the collaborative efforts and response to feedback from all stakeholders. 

Shared responsibility is encouraged for closer collaboration. If a development team shares the responsibility of looking after a system over the course of its lifetime, they are able to share the operations staffâ€™s pain and so identify ways to simplify deployment and maintenance. This is for example through automating deployments. 

Operations staff can share responsibility for the project goals where now they are able to work more closely with developers to better understand the operational needs of a system and help meet the needs. In practice, collaboration often begins with an increased awareness from developers of operational concerns (such as deployment and monitoring) and the adoption of new automation tools and practices by operations staff.

Automation is a cornerstone of the DevOps movement and facilitates collaboration. Continuous improvement with DevOps is exercised by working toward frequent but small software changes with every build iteration, carefully tested with automated tools and released to end-users at a faster pace.These improvements are inherently customer-driven and focus on improving end-user experience with every release.
